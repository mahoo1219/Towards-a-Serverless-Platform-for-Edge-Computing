\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we tackled the materialization of a platform for edge and fog computing with a serverless architecture. Different applications scenarios were matched with platform services; we also presented the rationale for inter-platform cooperation and management. A prototype extending a state-of-art FaaS platform was evaluated in terms of memory footprint, latency, throughput, and scalability. Obtained results corroborate the benefits of the serverless architecture and the feasibility of the proposed \textit{Serverless Edge Platform} in fulfilling the requirements from different types of application scenarios in heterogeneous fog node deployments. 

As future work, we are particularly interested in deepening 
two aspects: i) the decentralized inter-platform cooperation through delegation of requests to surrogate SEPs; and ii) the opportunistic placement of functions onto SEPs in a N-tier fog deployment through hierarchical orchestration to enable the co-existence of both latency-sensitive computation offloading and edge data analysis scenarios. Finally, we also envision the evaluation of the proposed platform services targeting larger scale deployments such as regional SEPs.
